# Penguin Animation
A playful penguin character built entirely with HTML and CSS, showcasing how to create an animated scene without JavaScript or external libraries.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how CSS alone can be used to create a fully animated character.
- HTML provides the structure of the penguin, background, and surrounding elements.
- CSS handles styling, animations, and interactivity (e.g., arm waving and scaling on click).
This is a great example of what can be achieved with pure front-end technologies without any JavaScript.

## Features
- Penguin created entirely using HTML and CSS shapes
- Animated arm waving using CSS @keyframes
- Penguin that scales with a smooth transition
- Gradient background, mountains, sun, and pond built with CSS
- Fully responsive and lightweight (no dependencies)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No additional tools or libraries required

### Setup & Run Locally
1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/mginham/penguin_animation.git
cd penguin_animation
```
2. Open the Penguin_Animation.html file in your browser.
That’s it — no build tools or servers required.

## Project Structure

├── index.html                # Main HTML file containing structure
├── styles.css                # CSS for styling and animations
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

## Notes
- All animations are CSS-based. No JavaScript is used in this project.
- The @keyframes wave animation creates the penguin’s waving motion.
- CSS transitions handle the scaling effect when clicking the penguin.

## Future Improvements
- Add additional CSS animations (e.g., blinking eyes or walking motion)
- Include multiple characters or an animated background scene
- Refactor into SCSS for easier style management
- Add media queries for improved responsiveness on smaller screens
